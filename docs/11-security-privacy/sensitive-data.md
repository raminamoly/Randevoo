## Practical notes for developers
Use the linked source files as the authority. Validate behavior with tests before changing production code.

## Practical notes for future AI coding agents
Do not invent missing behavior. If a feature is represented only by docs or UI labels, mark it as partial until a handler, endpoint, entity, or test confirms it.
